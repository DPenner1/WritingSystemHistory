Generally, in order to be included, the script must be able to fully represent a spoken language.

# Modern Scripts Inclusion Criteria

For space and sanity, some scripts have to be left out. In order to have semi-objective criteria for this, here's what I've landed on for the Modern Scripts diagram:

  1. **Currently used** writing scripts are included if they are:
     1. In Unicode, _and_
     2. In some natural non-moribund use. By "natural," this is meant to exclude new creations or revival attempts which are too recent to judge successful.
  2. **Historical scripts** are included if they are:
     1. An earliest known ancestor of a currently used script, _or_
     2. An intermediate ancestor that has more than one distinctly named descendent included on the diagram. Examples for this are:
         1. The script lineage of Sukhothai > Fakkham > Tai Noi > Lao. Fakkham and Tai Noi are excluded as they don't branch off anywhere else on the diagram, but Sukhothai remains as it branches to Thai and Tai Viet.
         2. The Telugu-Kannada script only branches into Telugu and Kannada, so is excluded.

Naturally, there's a judgment call here, made worse by the fact scripts on the boundary of inclusion/exclusion are also lesser known and hard to research. Most marginal inclusions/exclusions were due to this boundary.

# All Scripts Inclusion Criteria

In the All Scripts diagram, inclusion criteria turned out to be much less of an issue. It starts by including all Unicode scripts (up to v17 + Chisoi which was postponed to v18) and then including all non-Unicode historical ancestors (as per Wikipedia) by default. A few non-branching historical ancestors then get excluded for space reasons (I only recall excluding Tai Noi, an intermediate between Fakkham and Lao). I did specially include non-Unicode Maya and Indus scripts for historical significance, though admittedly the latter is not yet determined to be a full-fledged writing script.

A bigger issue in the All Scripts diagram was the consideration of what counts as separate scripts, especially as they frequently evolve gradually. This was purely a judgement call, mostly following along with Wikipedia, though Unicode's opinion on the matter is a strong influence. There are some "extra" scripts where Unicode considers it to be part of another one, but I felt it should be split out based on my reading of Wikipedia. Eg. Hieratic is considered a font variation of Egyptian Hieroglyphics.

*Note: For the most part removing non-branching historical ancestors resulted in being able to sidestep this question in the Modern Scripts diagram, but it was still somewhat challenging for the [Chinese script(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_script_styles) and [Georgian script(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_scripts). Note that having a few "extra" letters won't count as a separate script in this diagram.*
