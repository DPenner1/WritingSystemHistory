*At minimum, the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) article for each script was consulted. The same can be said of Unicode inclusion proposals (UIP) for those scripts included after [version 3.1](https://www.unicode.org/standard/supported.html). This file is mainly to document judgment calls and information from sources besides these.*

***Bold italics*** *indicate the script is included on the Modern Scripts diagram.*

  - **Ahom**: See Tai.
  - **Ancient Arabian**: The grouping of Ancient North & South Arabian scripts is generally called South Semitic, but Sources:
      - *[What is Ancient North Arabian?](https://www.academia.edu/33917069/Al_Jallad_2018_What_is_Ancient_North_Arabian)* (Ahmad Al-Jallad, 2018).

  - ***Asomtavruli (Old Georgian)***: Disputed origin. It seems the majority opinion is that it's derived from Greek, though some argue a Semitic or independent origin.
  - ***Baybayin***: Quite a few theories on origin, one of them is Gujarati which I am not including without stronger evidence as that would be hard to link with the current Modern Scripts diagram layout.
  - ***Bopomofo***: Based on it being used for computer input in Taiwan and Taiwan being around 23m people, I've bolded it for being used by over 10m people.
  - ***Brahmi***: The majority academic opinion seems to favour Aramaic origin, but some advocate independent derivision or derivision from the Indus Script. Also, seems the Northern/Southern Brahmi distinction is mostly geographic grouping convenience? I can't find a lot of sources making the distinction, and Wikipedia doesn't really cite precise criteria on the grouping, but it's useful for this diagram. See also Kharosthi.
  - ***Chakma***: Very few sources I can find. Wikipedia has Burmese derivision and citations seem reasonable. Others state direct from Brahmi (which I have to assume is Pallava in this context), or Khmer (seems rather unlikely geographically, even with expanded Khmer empire borders). Also, straddles South and Southeast Asia, but with majority in South Asia, that's where I've put it on the diagram. For origin date, as of this writing, Wikipedia has uncited 600. This is suspsciously too early to distinguish from Mon-Burmese. This source, the only I can find mentioning a date, implies was extant in 850: *[Origin and Evolution of Chakma Language and Script](https://mcdf.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/chakma-language-and-script.pdf)* (Jyotirmoy Chakma, 2010).
  - ***Cham***: Wikipedia gives an early date of c. 350. This appears to be from sources referencing a specific Cham inscription, though the sources at best seem to say late 4th century. However, it's not entirely clear these sources are specifying the Cham *script*, indeed Cham *language* seems to be more likely. For now it's given the benefit of the doubt on the chart, but I am extremely skeptical that a Cham script could have differentiated itself so quickly from Pallava. Sources:
      - *[The Early Cham Language, and its Relationship to Malay](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41492110)* (G. E. Marrison, 1975).
      - *[Études du Corpus des inscriptions du Campā, XIII: Documenting and Describing a Language on the Basis of an Epigraphic Corpus: The Case of Old Cham (Present Vietnam, 500-1500 CE)](https://hal.science/hal-04968896v1/file/Griffiths%202025%20Documenting%20and%20describing%20Old%20Cham.pdf)* (Arlo Griffiths, 2025).
  - ***Chinese***: Challenging as it generally evolved gradually and continuously over time. Stages are per Wikipedia's [Chinese script styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_script_styles), minus the cursive. My understanding is Unicode intends Clerical to be a font variant of modern Chinese characters.
  - ***Egyptian Hieroglyphs***: Source: *[Reading the Past: Ancient Writing from Cuneiform to the Alphabet](https://books.google.ca/books?id=9i8L8qxSsM4C&redir_esc=y)* (Walker & Chadwick, 1990).
  - ***Greek***: [Earliest lowercase is from 835](https://www.csntm.org/2022/04/22/manuscripts-101-a-brief-history-of-greek-handwriting/).
  - **Gothic**: Not to be confused with the [later variant of Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter). Greek derived, with some disputed additions from Latin and Runic. Between the dispute and number of letters, it probably doesn't count as an additional derivation.
  - ***Hangul***: Probably the most controversial (partial) derivision I've made on the All Scripts diagram, so I've got the references (in Modern Scripts it is shown as disputed). Basically there seems to be a credible theory that some consonants (and maybe a few vowels) were graphical simplifications of 'Phags-pa consonants, including 4 with the same sound value (a script used by the neighbouring fallen Yuan dynasty elites).

    > It has often been pointed out, especially by non-Korean scholars, that *han’gŭl* shows many similarities with *’phags-pa*, leading to Miller’s extreme position that *han’gŭl* was ‘adopted from the Tibetan-Mongolian »universal phonetic alphabet« of Yüan China’ (Miller 1996: 61) or is ‘the Korean version of ḥPhags-pa script’ (ibid: 145). The evidence does support the fact that certain forms of *han’gŭl* are derived from *’phags-pa*, but this is certainly not the whole picture. *han’gŭl* is in many ways a more original—and perhaps ‘scientific’—script than *’phags-pa* ever was.
    - The International Linguistic Background of the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People (Gari Ledyard, 1997), a chapter in the book *[The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=U8ACEQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&ots=8cNuBB8wMe&sig=gx5piRLw-oNUS5sTs7bqgthEn2c&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)* (Kim-Renaud & Young-Key, 1997)
         - This one I unfortunately can't find fully outside a paywall, but this seems to be the "canonical" paper on the 'Phags-pa theory that others cite, so you can search on from there. For example, *[漢字無罪: Politics and Divergent Orthography Strategies Following the 'Phags-pa Alphabet](https://www.academia.edu/download/61106594/Low_final_orthography20191102-53012-82gujh.pdf)* (Syd Low) makes the following statement and leaves a citation to it:
         > [...] it would have been unwise for King Sejong to explicitly mention the Phags-pa alphabet as having any relation to *hangul*. But the original explanitory [sic] text for the new script, the *Hunminjeongeum Haerye* 훈민정음 해례 訓民正⾳解例, lit. "Explanations and Examples of the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People,” does mention what could be translated as “Old Seal Script,” 古篆字. However because *hangul* does not resemble Chinese seal script, some propose the 古 is instead an abbreviation of 蒙古, Mongol.
    - There's also a Korean source, *[Vowel Letters of Hunmin-Jeongeum and Phags-pa Script](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/landing/article.kci?arti_id=ART001406063)* (정광, 2009) which while I cannot read (both the language and the paywall), the abstract is available in English.
  - **Hieratic**: See also Egyptian Hieroglyphs. There's a distinction between cursive hieroglyphs and Hieratic that not all sources make. Hieratic begins as cursive hieroglyphs, but eventually becomes distinct enough to be considered a writing system in its own right. Due to this, the chart shows Hieratic branching around the time it distinguished itself. Sources say Hieratic started to become distinct in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2050-1650 BCE, or possibly First Intermediate Period prior), becoming fully distinct by the New Kingdom (c. 1550-1069 BCE). Usually with a date range (here, 2050-1550 BCE), I would put the date in the middle, However in this case we have suggestion of it occurring earlier & one feature of Hieratic proper (consistent RTL direction) was in place around the start of the Middle Kingdom, so I've biased the date earlier. Source: *[The Transcription of New Kingdom Hieratic](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3854012?read-now=1&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)* (Alan H. Gardiner, 1929).
  - **Inscriptional Pahlavi / Parthian**: See Pahlavi.
  - ***Kana***:
      - ***Man'yogana***: It seems Man'yogana was simply using Kanji for phonetic values. Normally then, it wouldn't be a separate branch in the All Scripts chart (as there's no separate graphical development), but the switch from logographic to syllabary needed to be depicted somehow (Ge'ez has a similar switch, but the older abjad did not survive, allowing the same branch to be used). Also, I cannot find a solid citation for the end date. Wikipedia says Meiji era, so I've aligned it with the Hentaigana reform. Start date is the [Kojiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojiki).
      - ***Hiragana***: Some sources cite [Sogana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dgana) as an intermediate cursive step after Man'yogana. Not all sources make this distinction and cursive/print distinctions aren't generally shown on the chart, so it's not included.
      - Hentaigana: It is not shown separately as it's not a graphical development, just a definitional development. It's noted in Hiragana as Katakana was mostly standardized already so most variant kana came from Hiragana. In fact, Wikipedia currently explains Hentaigana as variant Hiragana.

  - ***Kayah Li***: Appears to have come up with many unique letter glyphs, but with likely influence from Burmese, so I've made it Brahmic & Independent.

While not currently incorporated into the diagram, it acknowledges that an earlier Kharosthi date makes it more likely that Brahmic could have derived from Kharosthi. If true, then at least the current diagram deriving Brahmi from Aramaic isn't entirely inaccurate with Kharosthi then being an intermediate script.

  - ***Kirat Rai***: See Limbu.
  - **Landa**: [Unicode roadmap](https://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3766.pdf) explains Landa is split into two regional classes, but there is no suggestion that these two sub-classes have separate proto scripts.
  - **Lik-Tai**: See Tai.

  - **Mahajani**: UIP suggests Kaithi or Devanagari as alternate ancestors. See also Landa, where a source puts it under Sharada.
  - ***Malayalam***: Old Malayalam language was written in Vatteluttu (not on diagram). Current script has some letters imported, but probably not enough to count on this diagram. At least one source has a merged Tigalari-Malayalam script for a while. Based on dates given in most sources and many discussing similarity, I've gone ahead and accepted a merged script probably existed. I saw a similar pattern with Odia/Bengali-Assamese/Tirhuta where many sources discussing the history of one just said old/proto [insert whichever script they were talking about], but there were more sources for these, some of which made clearer that the proto versions of these are the same or very close (and often called Gaudi). 
  - ***Man'yogana***: See Kana.
  - **Manichaean**: Not many sources, and they mostly disagree on the precise derivation. Geographically, I've placed it in West Asia due to its originators, even though seems the script ended up more used in Central Asia.
      - UIP has it as derived from Aramaic. In the broader sense, everyone agrees with this, but that doesn't mean there isn't an intermediate script.
      - [Manichaeism](https://books.google.ca/books?id=e9wk7DQRoPoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) (Michel Tardieu, 2008, p. 33) has it deriving from Pahlavi. This one is suspicious to me, as basically nowhere else even brought up Pahlavi, and script doesn't seem like the focus of the book anyways (though perhaps it means Pahlavi in a broader sense).
      - [Omniglot](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/manichaean.php) has it as Syriac derived with Sogdian influence.
      - [Encyclopaedia Iranica](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/manichean-script/) has Palmyrene as most likely ancestor. Given it cites 4 others (though I've only been able to find one), I've gone with this one.
  - ***Marchen***: Extremely confusing to research. There's a sense that the traditional [Bon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon) account places the origin too early. *[A New Look at the Tibetan Invention of Writing](https://tufs.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/11575/files/Old%20Tibetan3-03.pdf)* (Sam van Schaik) places it after the tenth century *[Where to Look For the Origins of Zhang zhung-related Scripts?](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=1b3509a782286771b2bab8259163b4f5bafc754c#page=99)* (Blezer, Gurung & Rath, 2013) is more vague but is compatible with this view point. The UIP says it's used even in the modern day, as does [ScriptSource](https://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&key=Marc). Given the specific use case, it seems non-moribund, so an inclusion on Modern Scripts.
  - ***Meitei***: Dating this one for All Scripts diagram was a bit tricky. Sources saying 11th-12th century simply appear to be more authoritative. Claims of inscriptions before this seem to all have various problems, and the former sources come after these were known. This also makes derivation from Tibetan which most agree on more time to happen. Sources:
      - *[Script and sound system of Meiteilon](https://www.academia.edu/95706925/Script_and_sound_system_of_Meiteilon)* (Sarangthem & Lokendro, 2022).

  - **Modi**: Two common traditional origin dates (1200s, 1600s) are clearly myths (in the academic sense). The latter is certainly not historic as a 1597 Modi document in exists. Sources:
      - *[Serving the barbarian to preserve the dharma : The ideology and training of a clerical elite in Peninsular India c. 1300−1800](https://www.academia.edu/24503898/Serving_the_barbarian_to_preserve_the_dharma_The_ideology_and_training_of_a_clerical_elite_in_Peninsular_India_c_1300_1800)* (Sumit Guha, 2010).

  - **Newari**: [The Indo-Aryan Languages](https://books.google.ca/books?id=J3RSHWePhXwC) (Colin P. Masica, 1993) p. 43 has the script deriving from proto-Bengali aka Gaudi. There's a fairly solid dating of the script to 908 in a Buddhist sutra. However, [Indian Epigraphy](https://archive.org/details/IndianEpigraphy/mode/2up) (Richard Saloman, 1998) p. 42 has Gaudi as starting in the tenth century, which generally wouldn't be enough time to differentiate. So one of three things must be true: They aren't that different, the cited derivation is incorrect, or Gaudi should be dated earlier.
  - **Nushu**: Just about the least certain for origin date. There's broad agreement peak usage was late Qing (c. 1900), but origin is totally unknown, with one source even having suggested Song dynasty (960-1279). Early dates are mostly speculation, with actual writings dating to late nineteeth century, so the diagram biases the date towards the later end. Sources:
      - ["My Mother Watched Over an Empty House and was Separated From the Heavenly Female": Nushu and the Writing IOf Religious Culture in China](https://prod-ms-be.lib.mcmaster.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/a280cd09-2c4c-4356-8908-32d24f0021f3/content) (Stephanie Balkwill, 2006).

  - ***Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong***: Several letters similar to Hebrew while appearing Thai or Lao in style. Seems reasonable for a script devised by a Hmong Christian group. Far from definitive, so I put disputed arrows.
  - ***Pahawh Hmong***, Appears mainly an independent invention, though significantly influenced by Lao. There appears to be some influence from Pollard and Fraser as well, but since that is lesser and it would be a mess trying to incoporate that, I didn't. Also, unlike the other abugidas, it seems this one's vowel-based.
  - **Pahlavi scripts**: See also Sogdian. Psalter Pahlavi is primarily known from a single source discovered in modern day Xinjiang, China. A second shorter inscription was discovered in modern day Afghanistan, dating to the 8th century so I've used that as the end date. With the two known sources being in separate regions, for simplicity, I'm going to consider it as likely developing within West Asia then spreading out. [Multiple](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avestan-language/) [sources](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pahlavi-psalter/) have Avestan borrowing a couple letters from Psalter Pahlavi, implying the Psalter script existed before Avestan, so I've made sure the start dates align that way. I've placed Avestan in South Asia, with it [likely originating in the Eastern Persian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan_geography) (modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan and maybe even India). For Inscriptional Parthian & Pahlavi, I can't find additional sources, I'm going off Wikipedia dates and the UIP which implies they are separately derived from Aramaic.
  - ***Pallava***: Derived from the Tamil-Brahmi variant of Brahmi. Dating is tight here with a vague "4th century" start date, see Cham.
  - ***Phoenician***: There's a credible alternate timeline where Proto-Sinaitic gradually develops into Proto-Canaanite which then regionally splits into Phoenician and Paleo-Hebrew (the latter in turn developing into Samaritan). Seems research is ongoing in the area, and Wikipedia has two different definitions of Proto-Canaanite, so for now I've gone with the current Wikipedia info-boxes. Sources:
      - *[The Alphabet Comes of Age The Social Context of Alphabetic Writing in the First Millennium BCE](https://www.academia.edu/39784078/_The_Alphabet_Comes_of_Age_The_Social_Context_of_Alphabetic_Writing_in_the_First_Millennium_BCE)* (Christopher Rollston, 2017).

  - ***Proto-Sinaitic***: See also Hieratic. Very few inscriptions survive to the modern day, making relationships a bit tentative. Proto-Sinaitic branches of Egyptian writing early enough that it seems unlikely to have branched from Hieratic proper, though may very well have branched from cursive hieroglyphs. I'm making a bit of an assumption on the writing direction based on Egyptian Hieroglyphs. Source (unrelated to the hieratic/cursive): *[Ancient Egypt and the earliest known stages of alphabetic writing](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/51112/1/UnderstandingrelationsFinal%20Proofs.pdf#page=61)* (Ben Haring, 2020).
  - **Sogdian**: As I write this, Wikipedia info-box has it deriving from Syriac. The source seems to be Gharib, B. (1995), *Sogdian Dictionary: Sogdian-Persian-English.* I cannot find this source outside a paywall, and no other source I can find has this, with them all deriving directly from Aramaic. Sources:

  - ***Tai scripts***: These were hard to research.
      - ***Tai Tham***: As I write this, Wikipedia has it deriving from specifically Old Mon with 3 citations. But one seems to not be in the citation given, one's behind a paywall, and the other seems to say the opposite, that it's a later borrowing. So I'm not too worried about deriving it specifically to Old Mon, and Mon-Burmese is fine.
      - **Lik Tai scripts**: Mostly relying on *[Script without Buddhism: Burmese Influence on the Tay (Shan) Sript of Mäng Maaw as seen in a Chinese Scroll Painting of 1407](https://www.academia.edu/download/106950535/s147959141200001020231026-1-q0d1ft.pdf)* (Christian Daniels, 2012) and *[Historical Evidence for the Early Lik Tai Scripts](https://www.academia.edu/40578293/Historical_Evidence_for_the_Early_Lik_Tai_Scripts)* (David Wharton, 2019). These are scripts with unclear relationships. Identification of Tai in 2012 of a 1407 scroll should by default override prior research. Previously, Lik Tho Ngok was assumed to be an early pregenitor ([aka Tai Le aka Dehong Dai](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/dehongdai.htm)). That scroll is however much more similar to Tai Ahom. Lik Tho Ngok samples are apparently absent till after 18th century which further counters the traditional narrative. Regionally, [Mäng Maaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ng_Mao) straddles South, Southeast and East Asia making the All Scripts diagram really tricky (the capital even spanned the border of modern day Myanmar & China). Given likely derivation of Lik Tai from Mon-Burmese, I'm placing it in SE Asia, given contact would have been from the South. Importantly, no one's calling the 1407 text Ahom itself, just similar. Ahom first shows up in [India in 1532](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadiya_Serpent_Pillar) (it's great when the inscription includes a date), so I assume some prior proto-Lik-Tai script exists before this (Wharton says starting sometime between 12th-14th c.).
  - ***Thaana***: Uniquely, the letters are derived from Arabic and Indic numeral systems. Numbers aren't generally considered a language so their representation aren't considered a writing system to be included in this diagram. Thus, Thaana gets the independent group in this diagram.
  - ***Tibetan***: See also Marchen. Source: *[Origins of Tibetan Script and its Role in Spreading Tibetan Buddhism Across the Himalayas](https://www.bodhi-path.com/index.php/Journal/article/download/152/104)* (Dechen Chuskit, 2024).
  - ***Tifinagh***: Marginal inclusion for both Tifinagh or Neo-Tifinagh on Modern Scripts diagram. Frequently sources would just use Tifinagh for the modern version, but sources that distinguished did tend to say Tifinagh had some limited use. I believe the confusion may lie in how related these scripts are. Libyco-Berber is a group of related scripts, with Tifinagh emerging as one, then Neo-Tifinagh was a standardization with vowels added (if I've understood correctly). Neo-Tifinagh was developed at a Berber academy in Europe, but I've opted not to branch it on the All Scripts diagram as it seems to be a small evolution.

  - **Tigalari**: See Malayalam.
  - ***Ulu / Rejang***: Rejang is part of the highly related Ulu group of scripts. I couldn't tell whether Unicode has Rejang as a stand-alone script or intended it to represent all Ulu scripts (with variants being dealt with in font).
  - **Zanabazar Square**: Source: *[Notes on the Pre-existences of the First Khalkha Jetsundampa Zanabazar according to His Biography Written in the Horizontal Square Script](https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/707752.pdf)* (Bareja-Starzyńska & Ragchaa, 2012).
