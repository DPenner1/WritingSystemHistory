*At minimum the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) article for each script was consulted. The same can be said of Unicode inclusion proposals for those scripts included after [version 3.1](https://www.unicode.org/standard/supported.html). This file is mainly to document judgment calls and information from sources besides these.*

***Bold italics*** *indicate the script is included on the Modern Scripts diagram*

  - **Ahom**: See Tai.
  - ***Asomtavruli (Old Georgian)***: Disputed origin. It seems the majority opinion is that it's derived from Greek, though some argue a Semitic or independent origin.
  - ***Baybayin***: Quite a few theories on origin, one of them is Gujarati which I am not including without stronger evidence as that would be hard to link with the current Modern Scripts diagram layout.
  - ***Bopomofo***: Based on it being used for computer input in Taiwan and Taiwan being around 23m people, I've bolded it for being used by over 10m people.
  - ***Brahmi***: The majority academic opinion seems to favour Aramaic origin, but some advocate independent derivision or derivision from the Indus Script. Also, seems the Northern/Southern Brahmi distinction is mostly geographic grouping convenience? I can't find a lot of sources making the distinction, and Wikipedia doesn't really cite precise criteria on the grouping, but it's useful for this diagram.
  - ***Chakma***: Very few sources I can find. Wikipedia has Burmese derivision and citations seem reasonable. Others state direct from Brahmi (which I have to assume is Pallava in this context), or Khmer (seems rather unlikely geographically, even with expanded Khmer empire borders). Also, straddles South and Southeast Asia, but with majority in South Asia, that's where I've put it on the diagram.
  - **Gothic**: Not to be confused with the [later variant of Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter). Greek derived, with some disputed additions from Latin and Runic. Between the dispute and number of letters, it probably doesn't count as an additional derivation.
  - ***Hangul***: Probably the most controversial (partial) derivision I've made on the All Scripts diagram, so I've got the references (in Modern Scripts it is shown as disputed). Basically there seems to be a credible theory that some consonants (and maybe a few vowels) were graphical simplifications of 'Phags-pa consonants, including 4 with the same sound value (a script used by the neighbouring fallen Yuan dynasty elites).
    - [Script ‘Borrowing’, Cultural Influence and the Development of the Written Vernacular in East Asia (Nicolas Tranter, 2001)](https://www.academia.edu/19593770/Script_Borrowing_Cultural_Influence_and_the_Development_of_the_Written_Vernacular_in_East_Asia)
    > It has often been pointed out, especially by non-Korean scholars, that *han’gŭl* shows many similarities with *’phags-pa*, leading to Miller’s extreme position that *han’gŭl* was ‘adopted from the Tibetan-Mongolian »universal phonetic alphabet« of Yüan China’ (Miller 1996: 61) or is ‘the Korean version of ḥPhags-pa script’ (ibid: 145). The evidence does support the fact that certain forms of *han’gŭl* are derived from *’phags-pa*, but this is certainly not the whole picture. *han’gŭl* is in many ways a more original—and perhaps ‘scientific’—script than *’phags-pa* ever was.
    - The International Linguistic Background of the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People (Gari Ledyard, 1997), a chapter in the book [The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=U8ACEQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&ots=8cNuBB8wMe&sig=gx5piRLw-oNUS5sTs7bqgthEn2c&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) (Kim-Renaud & Young-Key, 1997)
         - This one I unfortunately can't find fully outside a paywall, but this seems to be the "canonical" paper on the 'Phags-pa theory that others cite, so you can search on from there. For example, [漢字無罪: Politics and Divergent Orthography Strategies Following the 'Phags-pa Alphabet (Syd Low)](https://www.academia.edu/download/61106594/Low_final_orthography20191102-53012-82gujh.pdf) makes the following statement and leaves a citation to it:
         > [...] it would have been unwise for King Sejong to explicitly mention the Phags-pa alphabet as having any relation to *hangul*. But the original explanitory [sic] text for the new script, the *Hunminjeongeum Haerye* 훈민정음 해례 訓民正⾳解例, lit. "Explanations and Examples of the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People,” does mention what could be translated as “Old Seal Script,” 古篆字. However because *hangul* does not resemble Chinese seal script, some propose the 古 is instead an abbreviation of 蒙古, Mongol.
    - There's also a Korean source, [Vowel Letters of Hunmin-Jeongeum and Phags-pa Script (정광, 2009)](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/landing/article.kci?arti_id=ART001406063) which while I cannot read (both the language and the paywall), the abstract is available in English.
  - ***Hentaigana***: Maybe over 10m users? Wikipedia says its rare, but Japan is 100m+ people.
  - **Inscriptional Pahlavi / Parthian**: See Pahlavi.
  - ***Kayah Li***: Appears to have come up with many unique letter glyphs, but with likely influence from Burmese, so I've made it Brahmic & Independent.
  - ***Malayalam***: Old Malayalam language was written in Vatteluttu (not on diagram). Current script has some letters imported, but probably not enough to count on this diagram. At least one source has a merged Tigalari-Malayalam script for a while. Based on dates given in most sources and many discussing similarity, I've gone ahead and accepted a merged script probably existed. I saw a similar pattern with Odia/Bengali-Assamese/Tirhuta where many sources discussing the history of one just said old/proto [insert whichever script they were talking about], but there were more sources for these, some of which made clearer that the proto versions of these are the same or very close (and often called Gaudi). 
  - **Manichaean**: Not many sources, and they mostly disagree on the precise derivation. Geographically, I've placed it in West Asia due to its originators, even though seems the script ended up more used in Central Asia.
      - Unicode Inclusion proposal has it as derived from Aramaic. In the broader sense, everyone agrees with this, but that doesn't mean there isn't an intermediate script.
      - [Manichaeism](https://books.google.ca/books?id=e9wk7DQRoPoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) (Michel Tardieu, 2008, p. 33) has it deriving from Pahlavi. This one is suspicious to me, as basically nowhere else even brought up Pahlavi, and script doesn't seem like the focus of the book anyways (though perhaps it means Pahlavi in a broader sense).
      - [Omniglot](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/manichaean.php) has it as Syriac derived with Sogdian influence.
      - [Encyclopaedia Iranica](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/manichean-script/) has Palmyrene as most likely ancestor. Given it cites 4 others (though I've only been able to find one), I've gone with this one.
  - ***Marchen***: Extremely confusing to research. There's a sense that the traditional [Bon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon) account places the origin too early. [A New Look at the Tibetan Invention of Writing](https://tufs.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/11575/files/Old%20Tibetan3-03.pdf) places it after the tenth century [Where to Look For the Origins of Zhang zhung-related Scripts?](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=1b3509a782286771b2bab8259163b4f5bafc754c#page=99) is more vague but is compatible with this view point. The Unicode inclusion proposal says it's used even in the modern day, as does [ScriptSource](https://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&key=Marc). Given the specific use case, it seems non-moribund, so an inclusion on Modern Scripts.
  - ***Meitei***: Dating this one for All Scripts diagram was a bit tricky. Sources saying 11th-12th century simply appear to be more authoritative. Claims of inscriptions before this seem to all have various problems, and the former sources come after these were known. This also makes derivation from Tibetan which most agree on more time to happen.
  - **Nushu**: Just about the least certain for origin date. There's broad agreement peak usage was late Qing (c. 1900), but origin is totally unknown, with one source even having suggested Song dynasty (960-1279).
  - ***Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong***: Several letters similar to Hebrew while appearing Thai or Lao in style. Seems reasonable for a script devised by a Hmong Christian group. Far from definitive, so I put disputed arrows.
  - ***Pahawh Hmong***, Appears mainly an independent invention, though significantly influenced by Lao. There appears to be some influence from Pollard and Fraser as well, but since that is lesser and it would be a mess trying to incoporate that, I didn't. Also, unlike the other abugidas, it seems this one's vowel-based.
  - **Pahlavi scripts**: Psalter Pahlavi is primarily known from a single source discovered in modern day Xinjiang, China. A second shorter inscription was discovered in modern day Afghanistan, dating to the 8th century so I've used that as the end date. With the two known sources being in separate regions, for simplicity, I'm going to consider it as likely developing within West Asia then spreading out. [Multiple](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avestan-language/) [sources](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pahlavi-psalter/) have Avestan borrowing a couple letters from Psalter Pahlavi, implying the Psalter script existed before Avestan, so I've made sure the start dates align that way. I've placed Avestan in South Asia, with it [likely originating in the Eastern Persian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan_geography) (modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan and maybe even India). For Inscriptional Parthian & Pahlavi, I can't find additional sources, I'm going off Wikipedia dates and the Unicode Inclusion Proposal which implies they are separately derived from Aramaic.
  - ***Phoenician***: See Proto-Sinaitic.
  - ***Proto-Sinaitic***: There's a credible alternate timeline where Proto-Sinaitic gradually develops into Proto-Canaanite which then regionally splits into Phoenician and Paleo-Hebrew (the latter in turn developing into Samaritan). Seems research is ongoing in the area, and for now I've gone with the current Wikipedia info-boxes.
  - **Sogdian**: As I write this, Wikipedia info-box has it deriving from Syriac. The source seems to be Gharib, B. (1995), *Sogdian Dictionary: Sogdian-Persian-English.* I cannot find this source outside a paywall, and no other source I can find has this, with them all deriving directly from Aramaic.
  - ***Tai scripts***: These were hard to research.
      - ***Tai Tham***: As I write this, Wikipedia has it deriving from specifically Old Mon with 3 citations. But one seems to not be in the citation given, one's behind a paywall, and the other seems to say the opposite, that it's a later borrowing. So I'm not too worried about deriving it specifically to Old Mon, and Mon-Burmese is fine.
      - **Lik Tai scripts**: Mostly relying on [Script without Buddhism: Burmese Influence on the Tay (Shan) Sript of Mäng Maaw as seen in a Chinese Scroll Painting of 1407 (Christian Daniels, 2012)](https://www.academia.edu/download/106950535/s147959141200001020231026-1-q0d1ft.pdf) and [Historical Evidence for the Early Lik Tai Scripts (David Wharton, 2019)](https://www.academia.edu/40578293/Historical_Evidence_for_the_Early_Lik_Tai_Scripts). These are scripts with unclear relationships. Identification of Tai in 2012 of a 1407 scroll should by default override prior research. Previously, Lik Tho Ngok was assumed to be an early pregenitor ([aka Tai Le aka Dehong Dai](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/dehongdai.htm)). That scroll is however much more similar to Tai Ahom. Lik Tho Ngok samples are apparently absent till after 18th century which further counters the traditional narrative. Regionally, [Mäng Maaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ng_Mao) straddles South, Southeast and East Asia making the All Scripts diagram really tricky (the capital was even on the border of modern day Myanmar & China). Given likely derivation of Lik Tai from Mon-Burmese, I'm placing it in SE Asia, given contact would have been from the South. Importantly, no one's calling the 1407 text Ahom itself, just similar. Ahom first shows up in [India in 1532](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadiya_Serpent_Pillar) (it's great when the inscription includes a date), so I assume some prior proto-Lik-Tai script exists before this (Wharton says starting sometime between 12th-14th c.).
  - ***Thaana***: Uniquely, the letters are derived from Arabic and Indic numeral systems. Numbers aren't generally considered a language so their representation aren't considered a writing system to be included in this diagram. Thus, Thaana gets the independent group in this diagram.
  - ***Tifinagh***: Marginal inclusion for both Tifinagh or Neo-Tifinagh on Modern Scripts diagram. Frequently sources would just use Tifinagh for the modern version, but sources that distinguished did tend to say Tifinagh had some limited use.
  - **Tigalari**: See Malayalam.
  - ***Ulu / Rejang***: Rejang is part of the highly related Ulu group of scripts. I couldn't tell whether Unicode has Rejang as a stand-alone script or intended it to represent all Ulu scripts (with variants being dealt with in font).
  - ***Yi***: Just so much contradiction in the sources, I did my best.
