# Writing System History

This project consists of two diagrams:

  1. A minimalistic diagram designed to show the history of **currently used** scripts while fitting on both A4 & US Letter sized paper with 1/4" margins for easy printing.
  2. A comprehensive diagram showing the history of **all scripts** in Unicode, including a timeline and location of origin.

Note that the PDF & HTML versions are **clickable**: all of the scripts and most of the legend are linked to an appropriate Wikipedia page.

Here is the minimalistic diagram:

And a section of the comprehensive diagram (as the full thing is excessive for a README):

## General Diagram Notes

  - There are probably mistakes.
  - The diagrams show **graphical** derivision of scripts which can be very different from spoken language derivation.
  - "Specialized use" means use in specific use cases, but not for general default written communication of a language (or the language itself is specialized). Most frequently, this is religious or ceremonial uses.
  - I generally went with Wikipedia's article title for the name of the scripts, though there were some exceptions, particularly where Unicode had a distinct name for it.
  - The specific symbols used to identify writing system type were mostly chosen by taking the largest system of that type and simply finding something that worked with the font I was using. Though with Latin, I wanted a non-Latin looking symbol.
  - Some scripts have multiple possible writing directions or are difficult to categorize. There are multiple symbols for these, I attempted to list the most dominant first. For a few scripts written and read in separate directions (eg. Tagbanwa, Hanuno'o), the reading direction is listed first.
  - Sometimes scripts incorporate letters from other scripts. In order to count as a derivation, the amount of borrowed letters should be at least 20%. This percentage was derived from the Coptic borrowing of Demotic letters and hence ultimately Egyptian Hieroglyphic characters. I wanted this on the diagram as it appears to constitute the only *current* use of Egyptian Hieroglyph derived characters outside of the Proto-Sinaitic branch. For partial independent creation, the same percentage provisionally applies, but I find that less interesting so I might change that in the future.
  - There was effort to place independent scripts near related scripts. For the Modern diagram, this is linguistic similarity, for the All Scripts diagram this is more geographic.
  - The script groups in the legend are ordered by a rough estimate of total population using them.
  - Modern Scripts diagram was made in Draw.IO and All Scripts in Inkscape SVG, though I don't recommend looking at the SVG directly due to fonts not being embedded.

## All Scripts Diagram Notes

  - I did not show disputed derivations. I simply picked the majority opinion, or where there was no obvious one I could determine, I first favoured non-independent derivation, then whichever one made the diagram work better (generally when sibling branches originate around the same time).
  - Dates before 1800 in particular are frequently not known with absolute precision and might commonly have an acceptable range of a century, sometimes two. Part of this is lack of historical/archaeological record, and part of this is that scripts tend to gradually evolve so an absolute date is a bit nebulous. Unless I could find more specific text, when Wikipedia said something like "5th century," I by default put it in the middle of the century, so 450. I did the same for info-box dates like "c. 800" as I found this tended to be said as 9th century in the article text, so I moved it up to 850 in the diagram.
  - The structure allowed me to use the same box to show evolutions of a script (see esp. early Chinese). This does not imply older versions aren't still used for specialized cases (eg. Clerical is still used for calligraphy, old Georgian scripts are still used for religious purposes).
  - Lowercase development is shown in Greek & Latin due to these being significant graphical developments of the script (as is the purpose of this diagram). This isn't special treatment. Best I can tell, all other scripts with a case distinction either have mostly non-graphically distinct letter cases (lowercase is just small uppercase) or the cases appeared at the same time (within the timescale resolution), so is not a distinct evolution of the script.
  - Geography: The scripts are placed in regions (as defined by the Wikipedia articles) according to their place of origin, with reference to modern borders to keep things consistent. Based on script evolution, it was far easier to group Anatolian & Caucasian scripts with Europe (and under some definitions, part of the Caucasus is in Europe anyways). Central Asia is grouped with East Asia for two main reasons: it didn't have many distinct scripts & Xinjiang is surprisingly frequent. While part of modern-day China, for many historical scripts, the sources almost always say "Central Asia" when the area was under control of Turkic or sometimes Mongolian cultures.

## Modern Scripts Inclusion Criteria

For space and sanity, some scripts have to be left out. In order to have semi-objective criteria for this, here's what I've landed on for the Modern Scripts diagram:

  1. **Currently used** writing scripts are included if they are:
     1. In Unicode, _and_
     2. In some natural non-moribund use. By "natural," this is meant to exclude new creations or revival attempts which are too recent to judge successful.
  2. **Historical scripts** are included if they are:
     1. An earliest known ancestor of a currently used script, _or_
     2. An intermediate ancestor that has more than one distinctly named descendent included on the diagram. Examples for this are:
         1. The script lineage of Sukhothai > Fakkham > Tai Noi > Lao. Fakkham and Tai Noi are excluded as they don't branch off anywhere else on the diagram, but Sukhothai remains as it branches to Thai and Tai Viet.
         2. The Telugu-Kannada script only branches into Telugu and Kannada, so is excluded.

Naturally, there's a judgment call here, made worse by the fact scripts on the boundary of inclusion/exclusion are also lesser known and hard to research. Most marginal inclusions/exclusions were due to this boundary.

## All Scripts Inclusion Criteria

In the All Scripts diagram, inclusion criteria turned out to be much less of an issue. It starts by including all Unicode scripts (up to anticipated v17) and then including all non-Unicode historical ancestors (as per Wikipedia) by default. A few non-branching historical ancestors then get excluded for space reasons (I only recall excluding Tai Noi, an intermediate between Fakkham and Lao). I did specially include non-Unicode Maya and Indus scripts for historical significance, though admittedly the latter is not yet determined to be a full-fledged writing script.

A bigger issue in the All Scripts diagram was the consideration of what counts as separate scripts, especially as they frequently evolve gradually. This was purely a judgement call, mostly following along with Wikipedia. For the most part removing non-branching historical ancestors resulted in being able to sidestep this question in the Modern Scripts diagram, but it was still somewhat challenging for the [Chinese script(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_script_styles) and [Georgian script(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_scripts). Note that having a few "extra" letters won't count as a separate script in this diagram.

Along this line, there are some "extra" scripts where Unicode considers it to be part of another one, but I felt it should be split out based on my reading of Wikipedia. Eg. Hentaigana is encoded as a part of Kana in Unicode, Hieratic is considered a font variation of Egyptian Hieroglyphics, etc. A special case occurs with Jurchen which exists as a continuation of Khitan small. It's included as I did not want to show Khitan small going extinct if it simply evolved into Jurchen, though the precise relationships between the two and Khitan large (not on diagram) are not yet fully understood.

## Script specific notes

*My main sources were [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), [Omniglot](https://www.omniglot.com/), [Endangered Alphabets](https://www.endangeredalphabets.net/alphabets/) and Unicode inclusion proposals. Sometimes more academic research when things seemed fishy or incomplete.*

  - **Asomtavruli (Old Georgian)**: Disputed origin. It seems the majority opinion is that it's derived from Greek, though some argue a Semitic or independent origin.
  - **Baybayin**: Quite a few theories on origin, one of them is Gujarati which I am not including without stronger evidence as that would be hard to link with the current Modern Scripts diagram layout.
  - **Bopomofo**: Based on it being used for computer input in Taiwan and Taiwan being around 23m people, I've bolded it for being used by over 10m people.
  - **Brahmi**: The majority academic opinion seems to favour Aramaic origin, but some advocate independent derivision or derivision from the Indus Script. Also, seems the Northern/Southern Brahmi distinction is mostly geographic grouping convenience? I can't find a lot of sources making the distinction, and Wikipedia doesn't really cite precise criteria on the grouping, but it's useful for this diagram.
  - **Chakma**: Very few sources I can find. Wikipedia has Burmese derivision and citations seem reasonable. Others state direct from Brahmi (which I have to assume is Pallava in this context), or Khmer (seems rather unlikely geographically, even with expanded Khmer empire borders). Also, straddles South and Southeast Asia, but with majority in South Asia, that's where I've put it on the diagram.
  - **Hangul**: Probably the most controversial (partial) derivision I've made on the All Scripts diagram, so I've got the references (in Modern Scripts it is shown as disputed). Basically there seems to be a credible theory that some consonants (and maybe a few vowels) were graphical simplifications of 'Phags-pa consonants, including 4 with the same sound value (a script used by the neighbouring fallen Yuan dynasty elites).

    > It has often been pointed out, especially by non-Korean scholars, that *han’gŭl* shows many similarities with *’phags-pa*, leading to Miller’s extreme position that *han’gŭl* was ‘adopted from the Tibetan-Mongolian »universal phonetic alphabet« of Yüan China’ (Miller 1996: 61) or is ‘the Korean version of ḥPhags-pa script’ (ibid: 145). The evidence does support the fact that certain forms of *han’gŭl* are derived from *’phags-pa*, but this is certainly not the whole picture. *han’gŭl* is in many ways a more original—and perhaps ‘scientific’—script than *’phags-pa* ever was.
    - The International Linguistic Background of the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People (Gari Ledyard, 1997), a chapter in the book [The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=U8ACEQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&ots=8cNuBB8wMe&sig=gx5piRLw-oNUS5sTs7bqgthEn2c&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) (Kim-Renaud & Young-Key, 1997)
         - This one I unfortunately can't find fully outside a paywall, but this seems to be the "canonical" paper on the 'Phags-pa theory that others cite, so you can search on from there. For example, [漢字無罪: Politics and Divergent Orthography Strategies Following the 'Phags-pa Alphabet (Syd Low)](https://www.academia.edu/download/61106594/Low_final_orthography20191102-53012-82gujh.pdf) makes the following statement and leaves a citation to it:
         > [...] it would have been unwise for King Sejong to explicitly mention the Phags-pa alphabet as having any relation to *hangul*. But the original explanitory [sic] text for the new script, the *Hunminjeongeum Haerye* 훈민정음 해례 訓民正⾳解例, lit. "Explanations and Examples of the Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People,” does mention what could be translated as “Old Seal Script,” 古篆字. However because *hangul* does not resemble Chinese seal script, some propose the 古 is instead an abbreviation of 蒙古, Mongol.
    - There's also a Korean source, [Vowel Letters of Hunmin-Jeongeum and Phags-pa Script (정광, 2009)](https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/landing/article.kci?arti_id=ART001406063) which while I cannot read (both the language and the paywall), the abstract is available in English.
  - **Hentaigana**: Maybe over 10m users? Wikipedia says its rare, but Japan is 100m+ people.
  - **Kayah Li**: Appears to have come up with many unique letter glyphs, but with likely influence from Burmese, so I've made it Brahmic & Independent.
  - **Malayalam**: Old Malayalam language was written in Vatteluttu (not on diagram). Current script has some letters imported, but probably not enough to count on this diagram. At least one source has a merged Tigalari-Malayalam script for a while. Based on dates given in most sources and many discussing similarity, I've gone ahead and accepted a merged script probably existed. I saw a similar pattern with Odia/Bengali-Assamese/Tirhuta where many sources discussing the history of one just said old/proto [insert whichever script they were talking about], but there were more sources for these, some of which made clearer that the proto versions of these are the same or very close (and often called Gaudi). 
  - **Manichaean** *(All Scripts only)*: Not many sources, and they mostly disagree on the precise derivation. Geographically, I've placed it in West Asia due to its originators, even though seems the script ended up more used in Central Asia.
      - Unicode Inclusion proposal has it as derived from Aramaic. In the broader sense, everyone agrees with this, but that doesn't mean there isn't an intermediate script.
      - [Manichaeism](https://books.google.ca/books?id=e9wk7DQRoPoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) (Michel Tardieu, 2008, p. 33) has it deriving from Pahlavi. This one is suspicious to me, as basically nowhere else even brought up Pahlavi, and script doesn't seem like the focus of the book anyways (though perhaps it means Pahlavi in a broader sense).
      - [Omniglot](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/manichaean.php) has it as Syriac derived with Sogdian influence.
      - [Encyclopaedia Iranica](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/manichean-script/) has Palmyrene as most likely ancestor. Given it cites 4 others (though I've only been able to find one), I've gone with this one.
  - **Marchen**: Extremely confusing to research. There's a sense that the traditional [Bon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon) account places the origin too early. [A New Look at the Tibetan Invention of Writing](https://tufs.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/11575/files/Old%20Tibetan3-03.pdf) places it after the tenth century [Where to Look For the Origins of Zhang zhung-related Scripts?](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=1b3509a782286771b2bab8259163b4f5bafc754c#page=99) is more vague but is compatible with this view point. The Unicode inclusion proposal says it's used even in the modern day, as does [ScriptSource](https://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&key=Marc). Given the specific use case, it seems non-moribund, so an inclusion on Modern Scripts.
  - **Meitei**: Dating this one for All Scripts diagram was a bit tricky. Sources saying 11th-12th century simply appear to be more authoritative. Claims of inscriptions before this seem to all have various problems, and the former sources come after these were known. This also makes derivation from Tibetan which most agree on more time to happen.
  - **Nushu** *(All Scripts only)*: Just about the least certain for origin date. There's broad agreement peak usage was late Qing (c. 1900), but origin is totally unknown, with one source even having suggested Song dynasty (960-1279).
  - **Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong**: Several letters similar to Hebrew while appearing Thai or Lao in style. Seems reasonable for a script devised by a Hmong Christian group. Far from definitive, so I put disputed arrows.
  - **Pahawh Hmong**, Appears mainly an independent invention, though significantly influenced by Lao. There appears to be some influence from Pollard and Fraser as well, but since that is lesser and it would be a mess trying to incoporate that, I didn't. Also, unlike the other abugidas, it seems this one's vowel-based.
  - **Pahlavi scripts** *(All Scripts only)*: Psalter Pahlavi is primarily known from a single source discovered in modern day Xinjiang, China. A second shorter inscription was discovered in modern day Afghanistan, dating to the 8th century so I've used that as the end date. With the two known sources being in separate regions, for simplicity, I'm going to consider it as likely developing within West Asia then spreading out. [Multiple](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avestan-language/) [sources](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pahlavi-psalter/) have Avestan borrowing a couple letters from Psalter Pahlavi, implying the Psalter script existed before Avestan, so I've made sure the start dates align that way. I've placed Avestan in South Asia, with it [likely originating in the Eastern Persian empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan_geography) (modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan and maybe even India). For Inscriptional Parthian & Pahlavi, I can't find additional sources, I'm going off Wikipedia dates and the Unicode Inclusion Proposal which implies they are separately derived from Aramaic.
  - **Phoenician**: There's a credible alternate timeline where Proto-Sinaitic gradually develops into Proto-Canaanite which then regionally splits into Phoenician and Paleo-Hebrew (the latter in turn developing into Samaritan). Seems research is ongoing in the area, and for now I've gone with the current Wikipedia info-boxes.
  - **Sogdian** *(All Scripts only)*: As I write this, Wikipedia info-box has it deriving from Syriac. The source seems to be Gharib, B. (1995), *Sogdian Dictionary: Sogdian-Persian-English.* I cannot find this source outside a paywall, and no other source I can find has this, with them all deriving directly from Aramaic.
  - **Tai scripts**: These were hard to research.
      - Tai Tham: As I write this, Wikipedia has it deriving from specifically Old Mon with 3 citations. But one seems to not be in the citation given, one's behind a paywall, and the other seems to say the opposite, that it's a later borrowing. So I'm not too worried about deriving it specifically to Old Mon, and Mon-Burmese is fine.
      - Lik Tai scripts: Mostly relying on [Script without Buddhism: Burmese Influence on the Tay (Shan) Sript of Mäng Maaw as seen in a Chinese Scroll Painting of 1407 (Christian Daniels, 2012)](https://www.academia.edu/download/106950535/s147959141200001020231026-1-q0d1ft.pdf) and [Historical Evidence for the Early Lik Tai Scripts (David Wharton, 2019)](https://www.academia.edu/40578293/Historical_Evidence_for_the_Early_Lik_Tai_Scripts). These are scripts with unclear relationships. Identification of Tai in 2012 of a 1407 scroll should by default override prior research. Previously, Lik Tho Ngok was assumed to be an early pregenitor ([aka Tai Le aka Dehong Dai](https://www.omniglot.com/writing/dehongdai.htm)). That scroll is however much more similar to Tai Ahom. Lik Tho Ngok samples are apparently absent till after 18th century which further counters the traditional narrative. Regionally, [Mäng Maaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ng_Mao) straddles South, Southeast and East Asia making the All Scripts diagram really tricky (the capital was even on the border of modern day Myanmar & China). Given likely derivation of Lik Tai from Mon-Burmese, I'm placing it in SE Asia, given contact would have been from the South. Importantly, no one's calling the 1407 text Ahom itself, just similar. Ahom first shows up in [India in 1532](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadiya_Serpent_Pillar) (it's great when the inscription includes a date), so I assume some prior proto-Lik-Tai script exists before this (Wharton says starting sometime between 12th-14th c.).
  - **Thaana**: Uniquely, the letters are derived from Arabic and Indic numeral systems. Numbers aren't generally considered a language so their representation aren't considered a writing system to be included in this diagram. Thus, Thaana gets the independent group in this diagram.
  - **Tifinagh**: Marginal inclusion for both Tifinagh or Neo-Tifinagh on Modern Scripts diagram. Frequently sources would just use Tifinagh for the modern version, but sources that distinguished did tend to say Tifinagh had some limited use.
  - **Ulu / Rejang**: Rejang is part of the highly related Ulu group of scripts. I couldn't tell whether Unicode has Rejang as a stand-alone script or intended it to represent all Ulu scripts (with variants being dealt with in font).
  - **Yi**: Just so much contradiction in the sources, I did my best.


## Script samples (All Scripts)

I'm not an expert in all these languages of course. To try to show the samples neutrally, I generally used the first 7 letters of the alphabet (or Unicode Block where I couldn't quite figure out for sure the alphabetic order). The first three are uppercase and the next are lowercase when the script has casing (ABCdefg). For the Brahmic family which usually separates consonants and vowels, I tried to stick to the traditional ordering of consonants (*k*, *kh*, *g*, *gh*, *n*, etc.). Where the script was too ordered by appearance I did break this pattern to showcase a variety of distinct characters.

For scripts with a primarily vertical writing direction, the diagram is intended to rotated 90 degrees clockwise to read the script sample.

For space reasons, some only got 5 letters and others none at all. Otherwise when there is no script, this is because I did not have a font that supported it and did not want to go hunting for it (in particular if it's not in Unicode yet!).

Some scripts may appear larger or smaller. To keep things neutral, I simply used the default sans serif font on my machine and used a consistent software font point size. Size differences would be due to the font itself (it's been a while since I've done any graphical work on Windows so I'm not sure if it's the same, but my Linux Mint text programs generally just let me specify Sans and presumably selects an appropriate font that has the characters in question).
